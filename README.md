**GoHighLevel & Kajabi Expert**
Most businesses don’t have a traffic problem. They have a follow up problem.

I help fix that using GoHighLevel, Kajabi, and smart automations.

In GoHighLevel, I build systems that respond fast, stay organized, and close more conversations. Funnels that guide leads instead of confusing them. Pipelines that show you exactly where money is being made or lost. Follow ups that happen automatically so opportunities don’t slip away.

With Kajabi, I help coaches and creators turn expertise into structured courses and memberships that people actually finish. Clean course setup, clear client journeys, and email sequences that keep students engaged and moving forward.

Then I connect everything with Make.com and n8n. Leads flow in. Bookings trigger actions. Onboarding happens on its own. You spend less time managing tools and more time growing the business.

The outcome is simple. Faster responses. Fewer missed leads. More sales from the traffic you already have.
